Hi, I'm Jae Kim. I am an aspiring data scientist based in London. This blog is about some aspects of my learning that I would like to share with others.
I believe we can all learn more by sharing ideas. So please reach out in the comments if you'd like to get in touch.

Or you can also send an email to *bjk10@imperial.ac.uk*.
